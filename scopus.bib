	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate whether learned resourcefulness, an individual difference variable, was related to spontaneous process of change use over a 6 month period in a sample of newly enrolled fitness centre members. Method : Participants were 104 adults (56 women, mean age=29 years; 48 men, mean age=31.5 years) who at baseline were in the preparation stage according to the transtheoretical model (TTM). Participants completed paper and pencil questionnaires pertaining to learned resourcefulness, stage of change, and processes of change (POC) use at one or more time points (baseline, 1, 3, and/or 6 months into their exercise involvement). Results: Multilevel modelling analyses revealed that most of the variability in POC use was idiosyncratic and was explained by differential use of specific processes. Learned resourcefulness subscales accounted for more of the nomothetic variance in POC use than did stage of change. Conclusions: POC use can be predicted by baseline levels of learned resourcefulness. Persons with stronger self-regulatory capacity use more POCs across time, implying that they 'try harder' when attempting to maintain exercise involvement. Implications for intervention design and implementation include seeking increases in self-regulatory capacity and problem-solving skills to facilitate POC use and in turn promote exercise stage advancement. Present results highlight the need for continued examination of individual self-regulatory attributes that may contribute to the process of successful exercise behaviour change. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Problem Statement: Research has indicated that some mothers can cope with stressful life conditions and continue their lives normally, whereas others are unable to overcome such challenging conditions. Recent research has shown that mothers of children with disabilities are likely to know more about why some mothers have relatively well-adjusted lives despite stressful conditions, as well as why they cope better with these conditions than others. However, to date, studies in Turkey have only concentrated on the degree to which mothers of children with disabilities feel stress and which coping ways they use to curb the negative effects of stress. Purpose of the Study: This study aimed to examine the relationships between learned resourcefulness and ways of coping with stress. Methods: The study sample consisted of 222 mothers of children attending special education institutions during the 2011–2012 academic year in Sakarya, Turkey. The Self-Control Schedule and Ways of Coping Inventory were used to assess learned resourcefulness and coping strategies, the relationships among which investigated using Pearson correlations. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modeling, and data were analyzed with LISREL 8.54 and SPSS version 13.0. Findings and Results: Results showed that while three ways of coping— self-confidence, optimism, and support-seeking—correlated positively with learned resourcefulness, the other two—helplessness and submissiveness—were negatively associated with learned resourcefulness. The goodness-of-fit index values of the model (χ2/df = 2.10, RMSEA = .072, GFI = .97, CFI = .97, NFI = .95, and SRMR = .053) indicate that the model was of an acceptable fit. According to path analysis, learned resourcefulness positively predicted self-confidence, optimism, and support-seeking and negatively predicted helplessness and submissiveness. Learned resourcefulness accounted for 36% of the variance for self-confidence, 33% for optimism, 7% for support-seeking, 5% for helplessness, and 8% for submissiveness. Conclusions and Recommendations: This study demonstrated that learned resourcefulness positively predicted three ways of coping—optimism, self-confidence, and support-seeking— and negatively predicted helplessness and submissiveness. These results suggest that highly resourceful mothers of children with disabilities are more likely to use self-confidence, optimism, and support-seeking and less likely to use helplessness and submissiveness when coping with stress. © 2014, Ani Publishing.

As predicted, patients with high learned resourcefulness at intake improved the most during the first 12 weeks of treatment in the combined sample. However, the size of the effect was quite small and did not emerge when the two groups were analyzed separately. The relationship between learned resourcefulness and recovery was moderated by the severity of initial depression: SCS scores predicted improvement only among subjects who were more severely depressed at intake. These results may help to explain previous inconsistencies in reports regarding the ability of the SCS to predict the degree of response to CBT for depression. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

	abstract = {Research has shown that patients with depression have difficulty with performing daily tasks and meeting their own personal care needs. According to Beck's cognitive theory of depression, such deficits in adaptive functioning are affected by disturbances in specific personal beliefs that reflect the process of regulating cognitions. Rosenbaum's learned resourcefulness theory proposed that adaptive functioning is influenced by learned resourcefulness, while learned resourcefulness is associated with the process regulating cognitions. This study aims to test the mediating effect of personal beliefs on the relationship between resourcefulness and adaptive functioning. The study involved a cross-sectional design. Participants consisted of 187 adults with depression in southern Taiwan. The data were collected through four instruments: Cognitive Triad Inventory, Self-Control Schedule, modified Community Living Skills Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Both resourcefulness and personal beliefs were significant predictors of adaptive functioning, and personal beliefs mediated the effect of learned resourcefulness on the adaptive functioning of the adults with depression. The results validate the role played by personal beliefs in effecting learned resourcefulness and adaptive functioning among adults with depression and provide direction for designing nursing interventions that consider personal beliefs when teaching resourcefulness skills to adults with depression. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The participants included two NCAA Division 1 (U.S.) intercollegiate tennis teams comprising eight male (M age = 19.4 yr., SD = 1.2) and eight female (M age = 20.9 yr., SD = 1.4) players and their respective head coaches (N = 2, M age = 28 yr., SD = 5.7). Results of regression analyses indicated that learned resourcefulness was the primary predictor of athlete self-rated mental toughness and that competitive trait anxiety was relatively unrelated to coach and athlete-rated mental toughness. The positive significant relationship between mental toughness and learned resourcefulness suggests that the latter may be an integral component of mental toughness, at least among elite tennis players. Further research is needed to examine related components of mental toughness, including learned resourcefulness, and to determine the effectiveness of interventions that increase mental toughness to optimal levels, particularly as a function of sport type. © Perceptual & Motor Skills 2014},

In addition, the direct and indirect effects of learned resourcefulness among disease characteristics and quality of life and depressive symptoms were examined. Design: Descriptive, correlational, and predictive. Setting: Two teaching hospitals in southern Taiwan. Sample: 150 women with breast cancer. Methods: Participants completed demographic information concerning disease characteristics and learned resourcefulness via the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression questionnaire and the SF-36® health survey during visits to the outpatient oncology department. Main Research Variables: Learned resourcefulness, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Findings: About 35% of the participants had depressive symptoms. Participants with lower income and those undergoing adjuvant therapy displayed more depressive symptoms. Learned resourcefulness was a strong predictor of depressive symptoms and quality of life, but no mediating effects of resourcefulness on depressive symptoms existed. In addition, when participants had better income and were at a lower stage, a better quality of life was evident. Conclusions: A high amount of patients with breast cancer experience depressive symptoms. Learned resourcefulness can be a method of helping patients to improve their self-control behaviors and change their negative thoughts. Implications for Nursing: Nurses and healthcare professionals can apply resourcefulness strategies to promote quality of life and to prevent depressive symptoms in women with breast cancer.},

Sixty undergraduate students were rated as either high resourceful (HR) or low resourceful (LR) according to their scores on Rosenbaum's Self‐Control Schedule. Subjects were then pre‐treated with inescapable, escapable or control aversive tone followed by anagram solution testing. As hypothesized the learned helplessness phenomenon, the interference with new learning following inescapable aversive events, appeared only in LR subjects and not in HR subjects. No relationship was found between subjects' causal attributions for their performance on the noise task and their subsequent performance on the anagrams as would be predicted from the attributional part of the recent reformulation of the learned helplessness model. It was concluded that subjects' general repertoire of self‐control skills, and their general expectations for self‐efficacy, might be at least as important in explaining the generalization of helplessness from the training task to the test task as the kinds of causal attributions subjects make for their performance on the training task. 1983 The British Psychological Society},

	abstract = {A model of daily stress and metabolic control in Type I diabetes was tested in which stress has dual effects upon glycemic level: (a) direct, through psychophysiological mechanisms, and (b) mediated, through regimen adherence. Learned resourcefulness was postulated to moderate both effects. Two approaches to measuring daily stress were also compared: stress mean and variability. Daily stress and adherence were measured in 62 adult diabetics on six occasions over 2 months, after which glycosylated hemoglobin levels were obtained. Stress had a direct association with metabolic control that was not mediated by adherence. Although learned resourcefulness failed to moderate this relationship, it did relate directly to metabolic control, in the unexpected direction. The variables combined to explain 37% of the variance in metabolic control. The utility of the intraindividual approach to daily stress measurement was supported.},

	abstract = {People were found to differ in their coping dispositions (as measured with the MBSS, Miller, 1987): those who habitually attend to threatening cues ("monitors") and those who distract themselves from these cues ("blunters"). However, some people are equally high on both coping dispositions and they were considered to be in a "dispositional conflict". Furthermore, under certain circumstances people may prefer to act in a way that is inconsistent with their coping disposition; monitors who prefer blunting strategies and blunters who prefer monitoring strategies (labeled here as "disposition-behavior conflict"). Both conflicts were hypothesized to be associated with higher levels of trait anxiety and poorer coping. 59 men scheduled for surgery were assessed as to their coping disposition (monitors or blunters) and their preference for local or general anesthesia, and their learned resourcefulness (self-control skills). Monitors who chose general anesthesia (and thus were unable to monitor their own surgery) and blunters who chose local anesthesia (and thus were unable to blunt) were defined as being in a disposition-behavior conflict. Pre- and post-surgery measures of anxiety and dysphoria and post-surgery nurses' ratings were used for assessing coping with surgery. Patients who were either high on dispositional conflict or showed a disposition-behavior conflict were higher on trait anxiety and showed poorer post-surgery coping in comparison to patients without such conflicts. Learned resourcefulness was not related to better coping nor to the two conflicts with the exception that patients with a disposition-behavior conflict reported less confidence in their self-control abilities. Overall, preference for local anesthesia predicted better post-surgery coping.},

The findings yield promising evidence that the instrument is fairly easy for elders to understand when administered during face-to-face interviews. Evidence of reliability and validity is considerable, and the SCS shows acceptable internal consistency and contruct validity. These findings support the potential usefulness of the measure of learned resourcefulness for adults.},

High (HR) and low (LR) resourcefulness groups were created by using the upper and lower thirds of the distribution. On the day of the exam and a week later, prior to receiving results, subjects completed the Strain Questionnaire (Lefebvre and Sandford, 1985), Ways of Coping Checklist (Folkman and Lazarus, 1985), and other self-report measures. Results showed that HR subjects significantly reduced their problem-focused coping efforts from preparation week to waiting week, whereas LR subjects did not. In contrast, LR individuals reported significantly more wishful thinking, distancing, tension reduction, keeping to self, and self-blame during waiting week. For both measurement weeks, HR individuals reported significantly less stress symptoms than LR subjects. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

A sample of 103 subjects completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Rosenbaum's Self-Control Schedule, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Consistent with past research, it was found that the belief that others have perfectionistic standards for oneself (i.e. socially-prescribed perfectionism) was the perfectionism dimension most closely related to depression and low self-esteem. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of greater socially-prescribed perfectionism and lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in depression scores. It was also found that self-oriented perfectionism was associated positively with self-control. The role of learned resourcefulness as a mediator of the link between perfectionism and adjustment is discussed. © 1991.},

	abstract = {Obiective: The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of various personality variables, namely, the locus of control beliefs, learned resourcefulness and sociotropy-autonomy in the prediction of the level of depressiveness in hemodialysis patients. The dependent variable of the study was not the depression but the level of depressiveness measured by the back Depression inventory. Method: Seventy one permanent hemodialysis outpatients in a treatment center in Ankara participated in the study [43 females and 28 males with mean (±SD) ages of 44 (±9.68) and 52.6 (±7.8), respectively]. Beck Depression Inventory, Rotters Internal External Locus of Control Scale, Rosenbaum's Learned Resourcefulness Scale, Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale and Demographic Information Form were given to the patients. F test and one way ANOVA were conducted to examine the effects of sex and age groups, respectively, and then Stepwise Multiple Regression Analysis was conducted for prediction of depressiveness levels. Results: The oldest age group (defined as between 56-70 ages) and females had higher depressiveness scores, External locus pfcontrol and low level of learned resourcefulness, an indicator of ineffective coping skills were the predictive variables of depressiveness in hemodialysis patients when age, sex, and total length of time on dialysis were controlled. On the other hand, other personality variables, sociotropy and autonomy were not significant predicrors. Conclusion: Female patients and patients in the older age group were significantly more depressive, consistent with the literature, and the results were discussed in the light of the related literature.},

Worldwide, this condition is twice as prevalent in females as in males. To identify factors that may affect the development of depression in female adolescents in Taiwan, a cross-sectional, correlational design was used to examine the relationships among stressors, learned resourcefulness, and depressive symptoms. Four hundred four Taiwanese female adolescents participated in the study. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression were used to analyze data. The study findings suggested that low household income, dissatisfaction with grades, perceived poor health state, and poor peer relationships were significant stressors that contribute to the development of depressive symptoms. Adolescents with greater learned resourcefulness had fewer depressive symptoms. In addition, learned resourcefulness mediated the effects of perceived health and peer relationships on depressive symptoms. Health-care providers can use this knowledge to teach adolescents coping strategies such as use of learned resourcefulness to prevent depression and its negative consequences. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Rosenbaum highlights the prominent role that learned resourcefulness skills play in promoting mastery responses and goal attainment during difficult situations. Dweck, on the other hand, describes how students' beliefs about intelligence direct their goalsetting preferences and correspondent reactions to disappointing performance outcomes. Students completed selfreport measures assessing their learned resourcefulness skills, academic selfcontrol skills, academic selfefficacy, theories of intelligence, goal orientation, and attributions for academic failure. Our findings supported the integrated approach to understanding academic goal attainment. Students who reported engaging in academic selfcontrol behaviours possessed a betterdeveloped repertoire of general selfcontrol skills, believed in their academic ability to succeed, applied more effort in response to academic setbacks, valued learning something new in class more than merely getting good grades, and actually obtained higher grades. Theories of intelligence had an indirect association with academic selfcontrol through ability attributions. Directions for future research are noted.},

	abstract = {Background: It is important for the professionalism that students at the university use their coping skills to solve the problems that may arise before starting the profession, control their behaviours by directing themselves, and motivate themselves in case they face negative situations. Objectives: This study was carried out to determine the relationship between the selfleadership skills of students studying in nursing and midwifery departments and their learned resourcefulness skills. Design: The study a descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional pattern. Settings: The sample of the study consisted of 380 students studying at the Nursing and Midwifery Department of the Faculty of Health Sciences of a foundation university in Istanbul. Methods: The research data were collected using the information form, the Revised Self-Leadership Questionnaire, and the Rosenbaum Learned Resourcefulness Scale. In the analysis of the data descriptive analysis, parametric or non-parametric comparative analyzes and correlational analyzes were used. Results: In the study; 84.5% of the participants were female and whose mean age was 20.6-61.6% of the participants were studying in the nursing department. The total score the students got from the Revised Self-Leadership Questionnaire was 131.87 ± 23.49, and the total score that got from the Rosenbaum Learned Resourcefulness Scale was 120.81 ± 16.77. The students studying in the third-grade (124.16 ± 13.9) had higher self-control skills compared to the first (118.57 ± 18.8) and the second-grade (119.2 ± 16.7) students, that's, they frequently applied the coping strategies represented in the scale (p < 0.05). There was a positive linear relationship between two scale (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Within the framework of the research results, gender, grade and the department studied are related to the level of self‑leadership. The level of learned resourcefulness was associated with classroom and stress training. Individuals’ self‑leadership levels showed a positive relationship with their learned resourcefulness level. © 2021},

In this study, university students' self acceptance and learned resourcefulness levels were investigated longitudinally. 198 university students' self acceptance and learned resourcefulness scores were collected by Self Acceptance Scale and Rosenbaum's Self-Control Scale in their first and eighth semesters. The findings revealed that in general, the students' self-acceptance level increased significantly in the 4-year period. With respect to gender, the self-acceptance level of female students was found to increase during their university education, while no significant difference was observed in that of male students. Moreover, there was no change in the level of their learned resourcefulness in the 4-year period in terms of gender. As a result, it is understood that university life includes significant experiences for students' self-acceptance, especially for female students, and that university life does not cause any significant increase in the level of learned resourcefulness. Therefore, there is a great need for programs that will increase the resourcefulness levels of university students during their university lives. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Intervention aimed to teach adolescents that aggression is changeable behavior resulting from how they think and feel, emphasizing cause-effect relations; to facilitate their identification of internal cues, sensations, and emotions and their links to behavior; and to help them identify and acquire self-control skills, e.g., delaying temptation, using self-talk, and planning steps toward achieving goals. Participants were 447 ninth graders: 167 underwent intervention, and 280 from the same schools received no intervention (controls). Outcomes indicate the model's efficacy in reducing aggression. In the intervention group, both objective and subjective aggression rates decreased significantly compared to baseline and controls. Hostile thoughts and negative emotions did not change, suggesting adolescents could now control these without behaving aggressively. Analysis attributed aggression reduction to increased self-control skills. © The Author(s) 2010.},

In a second study, in which acquiescence response set and social desirability were controlled, Black students (n = 100) again had markedly higher scores than Whites (n = 138). In the White group, the RSCS had sound psychometric properties, but for the Black group Cronbach's alpha was low and items failed to group together coherently in the factor analysis. In the Black group, the absence of low-resourcefulness students was noteworthy. Two possible explanations are discussed. The first is a general stress-inoculation effect in people who live under deprived conditions. The second is a selection effect: Only resourceful Blacks succeed in overcoming the practical difficulties of poverty and disruption of school activities to enter a university. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {As caregivers undertake caregiving responsibilities over a long period of time, the burdens placed on them could lead to undue stress and affect their health. This correlation study examined the current situations and relationships among caregiver burden, health status, and learned resourcefulness (LR) of older caregivers who care for disabled older adults, and predicted the important factors that affect their caregiver burden. In all, 108 older caregivers were recruited from home care services of two hospitals. Structured questionnaire interviews were applied to collect data: the Caregiver Burden Scale, the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and the Rosenbaum’s Self-Control Schedule. Results indicated that the caregiver burden was negatively correlated with physical health, mental health, and LR. Physical and mental health were positively correlated with LR. The predictors of caregiver burden included LR, health status, economic status, and activities of daily living, which accounted for 58.60% of the total caregiver burden variance. © The Author(s) 2014},

The patient's perceptions of control are compared with their doctor's views about medical and patient responsibility for controlling the condition. Patients in this study, overall, have a low level of psychiatric morbidity, with only 7% depressed and with a lower anxiety level than those reported in other published studies. It was found that patients who view control of good outcomes to be in the hands of their doctors fare worse as far as physiological control is concerned. There was little congruence between the attitudes of doctor and patient pairs about responsibility for controlling the diabetes mellitus. The most important clinical implication of the study is that there appears to be a relationship between poor physiological control and a passive, dependent approach to the condition.},

	abstract = {Objective: Even though many young addicted smokers profess a desire to quit, majority of them are unsuccessful in their attempts. A major goal was to determine whether successful quitters are better equipped cognitively and behaviorally to deal with the adverse effects associated with the cessation process than unsuccessful quitters, because they possess a larger repertoire of learned resourcefulness skills. Method: Undergraduate university students, consisting of 69 never-smokers, 59 successful quitters and 61 unsuccessful quitters, completed Rosenbaum's (1980) Self-Control Schedule assessing one's general repertoire of learned resourcefulness skills. Daily smoking rate, age started smoking, years smoking, quit attempts, difficulty quitting, quitting importance, motivation, self-efficacy and use of smoking self-regulatory strategies also were compared for the smoking groups. Results: Never-smokers and successful quitters were significantly more resourceful than unsuccessful quitters. Even though both smoking groups smoked the same daily rate and started smoking at the same age, unsuccessful quitters in comparison to successful quitters viewed quitting smoking as less important and as more difficult, were more extrinsically motivated to quit, less efficacious, and used fewer self-regulatory strategies during their quit attempts. Discussion: The discussion highlights the prominent role that SCS scores, self-efficacy and especially perceived quitting difficulty play in the smoking cessation process. Conclusions and practical implications: Low resourceful smokers having difficulty quitting may find workshops on general life skills beneficial. Concurrently providing them with specific smoking cessation strategies may further serve to enhance these smokers' self-efficacy. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Family members often undertake caregiving responsibilities over long periods of time, which could lead to caregiving burden. A theory-based and culturally sensitive learned resourcefulness program may help family caregivers mitigate stress by learning and using self-help strategies. Objectives: This study's aim is to use rigorous methods to investigate the effects of a learned resourcefulness program called SOURCE (Chen et al., Geriatric Nursing, 2021, 45, 1129) to reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life (QOL) for family caregivers. SOURCE is an acronym for the six self-help behaviors at the core of this theory-based learned resourcefulness program, developed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with other researchers (Chen et al., Geriatric Nursing, 2021, 45, 1129). These behaviors are: seeking problem-solving strategies, organizing daily actions, using self-regulation, reframing positive situations, changing negative self-thinking, and exploring new thinking and skills. Methods: We used a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures for this study. The potential subjects were family caregivers whose family member was receiving home care. PI recruited 94 family caregivers (60 years old or older) who were caring for disabled and/or ill family members who also were 60 years old or older and living at home at the time of the study. The PI recruited these caregivers through the home care services department of a hospital and two community healthcare centers in Taiwan. The experimental group (n = 46) received the four-week in-person SOURCE while their family member continued to receive home care services, whereas the control group (n = 48) did not receive the SOURCE program while their family member received home care services. We collected data from the participants using the Caregiver Burden Scale, EuroQol-5 Dimension, and Rosenbaum's Self-Control Scale at baseline (T0, Week 1), after the intervention (T1, Week 5), and at follow-up (T2, Week 9). We analyzed the data using paired-sample t-tests and used the generalized estimating equation method to compare paired data between the baseline and follow-up. Results: Of the 94 recruited family caregivers, 90.4% (n = 85) completed the study. We found no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of demographic, caregiver burden, and QOL variables at baseline. Compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly improved caregiver burden scores (indicating a reduction in caregiver burden) at the end of the intervention and at follow-up. The experimental group had significantly improved QOL scores at follow-up only. The experimental group also showed high levels of adherence to and satisfaction with the intervention. The paired-sample t-test results show significantly improved learned resourcefulness between T0 and T1 and between T0 and T2 (t = −5.84, p < 0.001; t = −6.77, p < 0.001) for the experimental group. Conclusion: The SOURCE program helped family caregivers develop and use self-help behaviors during their daily caregiving tasks. The family caregivers reported satisfaction with the program as well as reduced caregiver burden and improved QOL after the program ended. Implications for practice: The SOURCE program can be implemented to improve family caregivers' caregiver burden and QOL. Community health nurses can improve self-help abilities of family caregivers by helping them to acquire abilities and skills that allow them to effectively handle stress and reduce their caregiver burden. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Stressful situations can put individuals at risk of developing adverse psychological problems. The aim of the current study was to investigate the mediating role of psychiatric symptoms in the relationship between learned resourcefulness and life satisfaction of university students. Method: Data were collected from 389 (285 women, 73.26%) Turkish university students from first year through senior year. To collect data, Rosenbaum's Learned Resourcefulness Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Brief Symptom Inventory were administered during a class period. A structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology was utilised to assess associations among variables. Results: The SEM results indicated that the hypothesised model provided a good fit to the data. The findings revealed that learned resourcefulness as a psychological strength influenced life satisfaction both directly and indirectly via the mediating effect of psychiatric symptoms. In other words, highly resourceful university students reported low level of psychiatric symptoms, which in turn were associated with life satisfaction. Conclusions: The implications of the findings were discussed in terms of cultural factors and intervention strategies for the enhancement of learned resourcefulness and life satisfaction among university students. © 2016 The Australian Psychological Society},

	abstract = {Providing and maintaining optimal care is challenging for older family caregivers who are caring for disabled older adults. Learned Resourcefulness can facilitate family caregivers’ self-help strategies, and Resourcefulness can facilitate help-seeking from others. However, little is known about how older family caregivers can effectively maintain and adapt self-help and help-seeking strategies over time, especially as the dynamic nature of caregiving for disabled older adults demands change. To this end, the Transtheoretical model (TTM) provides useful constructs that address family caregivers’ readiness to change their self-help and help-seeking behaviors. This paper reviews relevant literature regarding Learned Resourcefulness, Resourcefulness, and the TTM. The proposed conceptual model incorporates constructs from the TTM integrated with Learned Resourcefulness and Resourcefulness strategies to aid in the development and testing of interventions that are designed to promote the quality of life and health of older family caregivers while they are providing care to disabled older adults. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of empowerment program on increasing self-esteem, learned resourcefulness, and coping ways in women exposed to domestic violence. This experimental study was conducted between October 2012 and June 2014 in the obstetrics and gynaecology departments of the Giresun Maternity Hospital, and at the Family Counseling Center (FCC) in Turkey. Sixty women who agreed to participate in the study were randomly assigned into two groups. Data were collected by the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI), The Rosenbaum's Learned Resourcefulness Scale (RLRS), and the Ways of Coping Inventory (WCI). The assessment of the women before and after the empowerment program showed that women in the intervention group showed significant improvements in the SEI, RLRS, and WCI scores compared with controls. These results suggest that the empowerment program is an effective practice for increasing the levels of self-esteem, learned resourcefulness, and coping ways of women exposed to domestic violence. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Resourcefulness is an important phenomenon in promoting adaptive functioning in individuals experiencing depressive illness. A review of nursing and related literature revals increasing interest in the usefulness of learned resourcefulness. However, the theoretical and empirical literature also addresses several other phenomena of concern to nurses that seem similar or related to learned resourcefulness. The process of concept analysis provides a useful approach for examining important phenomena and clarifying similarities and differences from related concepts. The purpose of this paper is to explicate the concept of learned resourcefulness through the examination of its uses and consideration of model, borderline, related, contrary, and illegitimate cases. As a result, the defining attributes, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents are identified. Theoretical, methodological, and clinical implications related to the concept of learned resourcefulness are also discussed. © 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

Using a quasi-experimental study with one-group, pre-test and post-test design, we recruited a convenience sample of 30 older family caregivers who received home-care services from a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. The older family caregivers participated in and completed the four-week SOURCE program. Effectiveness and feasibility data were collected after the completion of the program. Results indicated that the SOURCE program significantly improved caregiving burden (t = 3.05, p = .005) and revealed that the program was helpful and useful to older family caregivers. The next step will be to use the SOURCE program with more older family caregivers. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Supporting previous literature, the heavier and medium weight groups of women were more dissatisfied with their weight and appearance in comparison to the lighter weight group, but all groups shared similar eating altitudes and lifestyle practises. Also as predicted, women with low resourcefulness skills had more eating disturbances, perceived less control over their lifestyle, were more preoccupied with their weight in comparison to the high and, to a lesser extent, the medium groups. Contrary to prediction, heavier weight women with low resourcefulness skills were neither the most dissatisfied with their body shape nor the most susceptible to acquiring unhealthy lifestyle practises and disturbed eating attitudes.

The effect of learned resourcefulness on workshop attendance also was examined, as previous research has shown that people possessing low resourcefulness scores are more likely to drop out of programmes promoting academic achievement. Participants completed Rosenbaum's Self-Control Schedule (SCS) measuring learned resourcefulness skills prior to group assignment and the Co-operative Learning Questionnaire (CLQ) assessing the use of group processing skills at the 3-week follow up. At different times, groups A, B, and C attended a workshop on academic self-management skills. These groups were asked to use the self-management skills described to help them prepare for the forthcoming test in psychology. Groups B and C members selected a partner to study with, but only group C members received an additional workshop on group processing. In support of previous research, students having low SCS scores were found to be more likely to drop out from the study than students having high SCS scores. Also, participants working with a partner showed academic benefits. Students receiving instruction (group C), however, used more effective group processing strategies than students who did not receive instruction. Nonetheless, students ' use of group processing strategies was positively related to resourcefulness regardless of whether instruction was provided.},

The self-regulatory processes are seen as affecting perceived self-efficacy. SCS was premeasured in a study designed to examine the effects of perceived self-control on pain perception. The data indicated that when given the opportunity, high- compared to low-resourcefulness individuals use self-regulatory processes. SCS was found to be related to the skin resistance response and rated anxiety during the study. No relationship was obtained between SCS and perceived self-efficacy. SCS did appear to differentiate subjects in terms of who is more or less likely to use self-regulatory processes on anxiety-related variables.

Results and Conclusions: Results indicated that chronic pain patients obtained comparable resourcefulness ratings to normal subjects but there were wide individual differences. Consistent with theoretical predictions, resourcefulness was found to be associated with better psychological adjustment and less impulsive health- care measures.

The data were gathered by administering the Parenting Style Inventory (PSD and Rosenbaum's Self-Control Schedule (SCS). The results of ANOVA pertaining to the scores of learned resourcefulness yielded a significant main effect for parenting style groups. Neither the main effect for gender nor the gender and parenting style interaction effect was significant. The findings suggest that those who perceived their parents as authoritative had a relatively high level of learned resourcefulness as compared to those who perceived their parents as neglectful and authoritarian. Findings also indicated that those who perceived their parents as indulgent had a higher level of learned resourcefulness than those who perceived their parents as neglectful and authoritarian.},

	abstract = {Successful coping with stressful events involves self-regulation. We identified three kinds of self-regulatory process. The first occurs automatically and unconsciously in order to maintain the homeostasis of a person's physiological functions; the other two are under the person's cognitive and voluntary control. Redressive self-control is aimed at resuming normal functions that have been disrupted; reformative self-control is directed at breaking habits in order to adopt new and more effective behaviors. Coping with acute stress requires redressive self-control; the adoption of new behaviors such as health related behaviors requires reformative self-control. Learned resourcefulness refers to the behavioral repertoire necessary for both redressive self-control and reformative self-control. This repertoire includes self-regulating one's emotional and cognitive responses during stressful situations, using problem-solving skills, and delaying immediate gratification for the sake of more meaningful rewards in the future. Research findings indicate that highly resourceful individuals cope more effectively with stressful situations and are more capable of adopting health related behaviors as well as other behaviors that require reformative self-control. © 1989.},

It is thought that, more secure attachment relationships lay the foundations of high capability of learned resourcefulness. This cross-sectional survey study aims to investigate the relationship between LR and attachment relations among adolescents according to whether they reside in care or with their families. To this end, data was collected from 61 adolescents with convenience sampling method, including 31 living with their families from Istanbul’s Huseyin Avni Sozen High School and 30 residing at foster care institutions. The total number of participants in this study came to 61, with an average age of 17. The Adult Attachment Scale (AAS), Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA)-Short Form and Rosenbaum’s Learned Resourcefulness Scale (RLRS) were used for data collection. It was found that institutionalized adolescents (IA) had a higher sense of insecurity in their attachment relationships than adolescents who stayed with their families (ASF). In addition, while there was a significant relationship between learned resourcefulness and attachment styles, those living with their families had higher scores on a number of RLRS sub-dimensions than those who stayed in institutions (p<.05). Discussion: The study findings already present in current literature on the issue were discussed and interpretations drawn, and it was deemed that institutional factors were important in terms of attachment relations and learned resourcefulness in adolescents living in care homes © 2022, Pegem Journal of Education and Instruction.

Methods: The participants of the study comprised 339 volunteering nurses working at Hacettepe Adult, Pediatric, and Oncology Hospitals. Study data were collected with Nurse Data Form, the Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale, the Locus of Control Scale, and Rosenbaum’s Learned Resourcefulness Scale (RLRS). Results: Nurses working at the institution for more than 25 years and working only the day shift had higher learned resourcefulness scores than their counterparts. There was a positive correlation between learned resourcefulness and autonomy. Among the sub-dimensions of locus of control, the only variable to have a significant relationship with learned resourcefulness was determined to be “self-control”. Additionally, autonomous personality type, self-control, and belief in an unfair world were predictors of learned resourcefulness in nurses. Conclusion: Nurses with low levels of learned resourcefulness are relatively younger and inexperienced. Thus, psychoeducation and group counseling might improve their autonomy, self-control, and cognitive coping strategies. Autonomous personality traits and self-control were the basic predictors of learned resourcefulness. © Copyright 2019 by Journal of Psychiatric Nursing.},

	abstract = {We designed two experiments to investigate the role of self-control processes in learned-helplessness studies by assessing the differential reactions to uncontrollability of subjects who presumably had either a rich (high resourceful, or HR) or poor (low resourceful, or LR) repertoire of self-control skills. HR and LR subjects received noncontingent success feedback, failure feedback, or no feedback on a task that ostensibly assessed "therapeutic abilities." Subjects were subsequently tested on insolvable puzzles (Experiment 1) or on solvable anagrams (Experiment 2). According to Kanfer and Hagerman's (1981)self-regulation model, self-regulatory activities are evoked primarily in situations in which subjects are faced with repeated failure. Hence we predicted that individual differences in self-control would influence performance on the insolvable puzzles and not anagram performance after exposure to noncontingent failure. This prediction was confirmed: Only the performance of LR subjects on the insolvable puzzles was debilitated by the helplessness induction, whereas HR and LR subjects showed equal helplessness-induced deficits on the anagrams. The latter finding was interpreted in terms of the learned-helplessness model without the mediating effects of self-regulatory processes. As predicted from the self-control model, HR subjects more frequently checked statements indicating positive self-evaluations and task-oriented thoughts and less frequently checked negative self-evaluations than did LR subjects during exposure to uncontrollability in both experiments. We concluded that the self-control model accounts best for subjects' self-reactions during exposure to uncontrollability or failure, whereas the learned-helplessness model accounts for the generalization of helplessness from uncontrollable situations to controllable ones. © 1985 American Psychological Association.},

Design: Quasi-experimental with repeated measures. Setting: Two large hospitals in Israel. Sample: 46 patients with NHL. Methods: On the first day of a cycle of chemotherapy treatment, participants completed questionnaires assessing fatigue and learned resourcefulness. Fatigue was assessed again after 10 and 21 days. Main Research Variables: Cancer-related fatigue, learned resourcefulness. Findings: Fatigue increased 10 days following chemotherapy treatment and returned to pretreatment levels at day 21. Learned resourcefulness correlated negatively with each of the three measurements of fatigue. In addition, a calculated partial correlation showed the specific effect of learned resourcefulness on chemotherapy-related fatigue. Conclusions: The findings showed a negative correlation between a physiologic variable (fatigue) and a psychological variable (learned resourcefulness), which is related to individual coping ability. Implications for Nursing: Nurses should receive education about learned resourcefulness to potentially help patients with cancer cope with chemotherapy-related fatigue. Knowledge Translation: As learned resourcefulness was negatively correlated with chemotherapy-related fatigue in patients with NHL, having this personality trait may help those patients manage fatigue. © 2013 by the Oncology Nursing Society.},

Method: Gadzella's Student-life Stress Inventory (SSI) and Rosenbaum's Self-Control Scale (SCS) administered to 85 students in two groups upon admission and graduation. Results: LR increased, while stress decreased significantly in both groups (p < 0.05). Both groups (95.3% female, 85.8% Caucasian) reported similarly high frustration, pressure, and emotional reactions to stress. Significant relationship between taking tests and stress (p < 0.01). Stressors (p < 0.05) and age (p < 0.01) significant predictors of academic performance. Significant correlations of LR and work status (p < 0.01), and increased self-esteem (p < 0.05). No significant relationships among LR, stressors, and academic performance. Conclusion: Results validate high levels of stress and suggest that higher LR enhances coping skills and decreases stress longitudinally, which can improve academic performance and retention. Implications for International Audience: Trends and relationships in stressors and LR should be explored internationally in larger, more diverse samples of college students in nursing and other majors in relation to depression, anxiety, health-related behaviors, demographics, and academic performance. LR can be assessed, taught, learned, and enhanced. Greater numbers of qualified, competent nursing graduates with stronger clinical judgment, coping, and problem-solving skills will address the critical global nursing shortage and improve the quality, safety, and access of health care worldwide.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

However, little research exists on the relative influence of different self-regulatory skills models for specific applications, with all relevant constructs considered simultaneously. This study evaluated the contributions of the selfregulatory models of learned resourcefulness and selfmanagement to the outcome variable of affective symptomatology. Specifically, structural equation modeling was used to test whether learned resourcefulness accounts for additional variance in affective symptomatology when taking self-management into consideration. Results indicated that both learned resourcefulness and self-management accounted for a large proportion of variance in affective symptomatology, and the model in which the path between learned resourcefulness and affective symptomatology was constrained to zero provided the best fit of the data, tentatively suggesting that learned resourcefulness did not seem to add much value in terms of predicting affective symptomatology when in the presence of self-management.

	abstract = {Anxiety levels were measured before and after ultrasound examination in 183 women who underwent the procedure as part of their routine prenatal care. Women were classified according to their preferred mode of information gathering, their amount of available cognitive resources and predetermined feedback conditions. The results indicated significant reductions in state or situational anxiety levels for all subjects while trait anxiety was unaffected. In addition, the results suggested a correspondence between learned resourcefulness and informational coping styles. Women who had higher levels of cognitive resources and actively sought out information showed significantly greater decreases in state anxiety levels. This finding was also true for women who had lower levels of cognitive resources and tended to block out information. The impact of the scan was more profoundly affected by personality repertoires and informational coping styles than by either of the feedback conditions.

	abstract = {Background: Learned resourcefulness plays a significant role in facilitating maternal coping during the transition to motherhood. Given the growing evidence of perinatal depression and the frequent feeling of incompetence in the maternal role, the implementation of an effective intervention to promote maternal role competence and emotional well-being is essential. Objectives: To determine the impact of a childbirth psychoeducation program based on the concept of learned resourcefulness on maternal role competence and depressive symptoms in Chinese childbearing women. Design: A pretest-posttest, control group quasi-experimental design with repeated measures was used. Setting: The study was conducted in two regional public hospitals in Hong Kong that provide routine childbirth education programs with similar content and structure. One hospital was being randomly selected as the experimental hospital. Participants: A convenience sample of 184 Chinese pregnant women attending the childbirth education was recruited between October 2005 and April 2007. Inclusion criteria were primiparous with singleton and uneventful pregnancy, at gestation between 12 and 35 weeks, and did not have a past or familial psychiatric illness. Methods: The intervention was a childbirth psychoeducation program that was incorporated into the routine childbirth education in the experimental hospital. The experimental group (n = 92) received the childbirth psychoeducation program and the routine childbirth education. The comparison group (n = 92) received the routine childbirth education alone in the comparison hospital. Outcomes were measured by the Self-Control Schedule, Parenting Sense of Competence Scale-Efficacy subscale and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at baseline, immediately post-intervention, at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results: Women receiving the childbirth psychoeducation program had significant improvement in learned resourcefulness at 6 weeks postpartum (p = 0.004) and an overall reduction in depressive symptoms (p = 0.01) from baseline to 6 months postpartum compared with those who only received the routine childbirth education after adjusting for baseline group differences on age and social support. No significant group difference was found on maternal role competence. Conclusions: The childbirth psychoeducation program appears to be a very promising intervention for promoting learned resourcefulness and minimizing the risk of perinatal depression in first-time Chinese childbearing women. Future empirical work is required to determine the effectiveness of extending the childbirth psychoeducation program into the early postpartum for the promotion of maternal role competence in Chinese childbearing women. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {It is well recognized that patients with diabetes encounter a host of daily self-care issues, including controlling blood sugar and preventing and managing complications, which impact significantly upon quality of life. Studies have indicated that learned resourcefulness has a potentially positive effect in dealing with psychosocial and health problems. The purpose of this study was to test the relationship between learned resourcefulness and quality of life in type II diabetic patients. The mediating and moderating effects of learned resourcefulness on the relationship between metabolic control and quality of life of diabetic patients was also examined. This cross-sectional and correlational study included a convenience sample of 131 type II diabetic patients recruited from three hospitals in southern Taiwan. Data were collected through questionnaires, which included the Rosenbaum’s Self Control Schedule and World Health Organization’s Quality of Life (Short Version). Multiple regression techniques were used to analyze outcome predictors. Study findings include identification of a mediating effect of learned resourcefulness between metabolic control and quality of life. While most DM patients were not satisfied with their health, we found that those with greater learned resourcefulness enjoyed a better quality of life. Learned resourcefulness, gender, and HbA1C explained 35.2% of variance in DM patient quality of life. Male diabetic patients enjoyed a better quality of life than females, even though levels of learned resourcefulness between the two groups were not significantly different. Results indicate that poor metabolic control of diabetic patients has a detrimental effect on quality of life, and when diabetic patients use more self-control skills, they may achieve better quality of life. Results suggest that nurses who use cognitive behavior coping strategies (resourcefulness) may help diabetic patients achieve better metabolic control and promote better quality of life. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between learned resourcefulness and two common addictive behaviors, namely, drinking and smoking. Male and female college students (N = 175) completed the Self-Control Schedule (SCS), the Quantity-Frequency-Variability questionnaire, and a smoking history form. Learned resourcefulness was related to self-reported patterns of alcohol consumption; specifically, heavy drinking subjects were lower in learned resourcefulness than were light and moderate drinkers who, in turn, were lower in learned resourcefulness than were infrequent drinkers and abstainers. Learned resourcefulness was only modestly related to smoking, with students who had never smoked evidencing somewhat higher learned resourcefulness than ex-smokers and current smokers. Overall, these data provide correlational support for the notion that learned resourcefulness may protect young adults against substance abuse. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
